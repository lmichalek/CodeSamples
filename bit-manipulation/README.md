#Bit Manipulation Puzzles

This is a series of functions that utilize bit patterns to manipulate integers. Each function is limited to using only certain types of bit operations and a certain number of them.

There are three main categories of functions:

1. Bit manipulation - functions that manipulate & test sets of bits

2. Two's complement arithmetic - involve two's complement representations

3. Floating point arithmetic - operations on bit-level representations of floating point numbers.
                             
Some selected examples:

 * ```bang(x)``` - Compute ```!x``` without using ```!```
  
 * ```float_f2i(f)``` - Given ```float f```, compute ```(int) f```
                      
 * ```howManyBits(x)``` - Return the minimum number of bits needed to represent ```x``` in two's complement

All functions have a header containing a description & examples.
